Original Submission Comment:

hangmanterminal and hangmangui are the files to run, hangmancore is

where the interpreter will have trouble reading the included wordlist
but you will find it very hard to reproduce.

I eagerly await my -3 points for insubordination


(Note: Cartoon violence is depicted against my professor in this one. This
was an explicitly sanctioned feature by the professor in question,
who thought it was very funny)
