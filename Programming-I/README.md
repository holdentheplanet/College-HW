This README will be updated in due time.

For the very earliest adopters to this repo, this serves
as a record of the various programming assignments completed
as a result of the CSCI 220 and accompanying lab course
from the College of Charleston.

The uploaded assignments will likely not be the exact originals as 
they were written in the course. I will likely make small tweaks to
improve readibility to the wider audience the programs herein 
will now have. 

All programs herein will be written in Python
